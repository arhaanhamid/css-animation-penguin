Learn intermediate CSS animations using HTML and CSS by creating an animated Penguin...
This is an intermediate version of How to use CSS animations...
I am using...
transform: rotatating, scaling, skewing etc
animation: duration, iteration, type etc
keyframes...

Just open in a webpage and watch the animation first and then check code, it's easy to understand
